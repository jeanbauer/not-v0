# NOT V0

This project was created to showcase the concepts discussed in [this article](https://jeanbauer.vercel.app/articles/generative-ui). While it might look a bit like Vercel's v0, it’s **not** meant to be a clone—though building one for learning purposes would be a cool exercise.

You're encouraged to plug in your own OpenAI API key and experiment with it however you'd like. Have fun!

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
